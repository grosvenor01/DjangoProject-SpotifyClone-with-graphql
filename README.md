# DjangoProject-SpotifyClone-with-graphql
I used the REST API in my graduation project, which was a management system for graduation projects. However, I found it confusing to deal with unnecessary data that was returned in the page, such as default user model data. It was also time-consuming to build a view for each page. In search of a solution for my future big project, I discovered GraphQL technology, which allows for sending and receiving only the required data. I practiced using this technology with Django in a simple project, and it was easy to understand. While REST has its advantages, GraphQL provided a solution for overloading data on the server. Using both technologies in larger projects can be a good approach for building smooth websites.
